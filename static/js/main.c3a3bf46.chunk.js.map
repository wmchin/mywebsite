It intends to ease and gamify communication particularly between family members.\nI worked in a team with two others to invent and produce Telur.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"why\">Why?</h5>\n<p>\nIt all started with a simple thought: <b>“Have you ever had something to tell your parents, but didn’t know how to?”</b>.\nCommunication is a critical part of any relationship, yet there are many factors which can hinder communication. After chatting more with my teammates and relating our own personal situations together, we were able to boil it down to three main factors we could work on to help boost communication.\n<ol>\n<b><li>Timing</li></b>\nAs international students, we often find it hard to find a good time to talk with our families back home in different time zones.\n<b><li>Awkwardness</li></b>\nSome families haven’t established a comfortable space for family members to share their thoughts and what’s happening in their lives with each other.\n<b><li>Lack of Content</li></b>\nPeople want to be closer to their families, but don’t know how or what to talk to them about.\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"whytelur\">Why Telur?</h5>\n<p>\nWe came up with a few ideas as to how to combat these factors and to ultimately enhance familial bonds. For example, besides Telur, another strong contender was an app we called <b>Rekinder</b>, which starts a fire between two people, and prompts them with deep questions and scenarios such that when these prompts are answered by the two persons then the fire grows stronger/bigger and likewise, if the conversation starts dying between them so does the fire. This was heavily trying to target the “Lack of Content” factor and aimed at facilitating deep conversations.\n\nIn order to <b>narrow down our scope</b>, we created <b>storyboards</b> for the general direction we were going (trying to enhance family communication) and and paper prototypes for both of the applications we thought of (Telur and Rekinder).\n</p>\n<h6>3 Storyboards</h6>\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/Storyboard1.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/Storyboard2.png')} width=\"100%\"  alt=\"\" />\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/Storyboard3.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n<h6>2 Paper Prototypes - Telur & Rekinder</h6>\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/telurpaper.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/rekinderpaper.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n<p>\nUsing these paper prototypes, we were able to conduct <b>heuristic evaluations</b> on both app ideas, done by our peers and fellow students in our school. During this time, we observed the user and followed their mental flow through our app and were able to spot a lot of areas that were lacking and could use improvement, and areas that we’d never thought about venturing into. There was a lot more feedback and receptive enthusiasm when users toyed with Telur compared to Rekinder, and so, we decided to move forward focusing on Telur!\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"process\">The Process</h5>\n<h5 id=\"video\">Video Prototype</h5>\n<p>\nWith this newfound focus, we made a <b>video prototype</b> to demonstrate in a more realistic environment how we envision our app being used. I was responsible for acting and editing the video and contributed to the planning and storyboarding, which in the end was largely based on the earlier storyboards we did.\nYou can view <a href=\"https://youtu.be/89vT891ubVA\">the video on Youtube here</a>.\n<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"wire\">Wireframe</h5>\n<p>\nWe followed this with <b>wireframing</b> of two key components of our application. I used <b>Sketch</b> to create the wireframes, and started with many options before finalizing with my team. The process I took with this was to first outline all the important details, actions and items that we wanted to have on each page/component. Then, I drew a rough sketch on paper of multiple different ways to lay these items out. Finally, I narrowed it down to a few and wireframed those on Sketch (which I learned on the fly, this was my first time using it). Having these more solid layouts, I showed them to my teammates and we went over changes that we could make, integrating the parts we liked from each different design to come together into one that we were all satisfied with.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h6>Wireframes - Home Page & Lay Page</h6>\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/telurwire.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/lay1.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/lay2.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h5 id=\"code\">Coding</h5>\n<p>\nBased on our wireframes, we were able to code up these two screens. We worked collaboratively through <b>GitHub</b> and deployed our website on Heroku and rerouted to a domain we purchased. The libraries we used to build the web app were <b>React and Semantic UI</b>. It was my first time also touching on these libraries so it was a good experience to learn all of these new things. I also used <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> to create the hatching eggs/chickens for the “Hatch” page.\n<br /> <br/></p>\n<h5 id=\"user\">User Testing</h5>\n<p>\nWe continued to code up our web application until finally it was ready for <b>testing</b>! We developed a testing protocol, so that we could be standardized in our testing. We recruited peers and students from our school to be our testers. During the test, the users were expected to complete two tasks: “Sending a Message” and “Opening a Message”, which we deemed as key features and interactions of our application. The approach we took was to be distant, and to assume a more of a prompting role, than to be heavily involved in the test. We wanted the user to feel free and true in all their actions, and we wanted to hear their thoughts purely without any outside influence. We asked them to voice aloud their actions and thoughts, and what they expected to happen at each step they took. After observing the users go through the tasks, and taking notes along the way of their mental model and expectations, we had a short post-use questionnaire, which we delivered verbally. We asked 7 questions, targeted at finding the weak and strong spots of our application and mismatches in mental models that we had when designing the application.\n<br /> <br />\n<ol>\n<li>How easy or difficult was it to send and read a message, compare to sending an email for example? (1 to 5, 1: very easy, 5: very difficult, send and read have its own rating)\n</li>\n<li>What are your thoughts on the farm theme of the app and how easy or difficult is it to understand?\n</li>\n<li>Which parts of the application or what tasks did you struggle with the most?\n</li>\n<li>What suggestions do you have to improve the application/user experience of Telur?\n</li>\n<li>Were there any major confusions/parts that did not meet your expectations? (e.g. missing buttons/actions, missing pages, etc.)\n</li>\n<li>What other functionalities would you want to add to Telur?\n</li>\n<li>Any other comments?\n</li>\n</ol></p><br />\n<h5 id=\"redesign\">Redesign</h5>\n<p>\nThe results that we received from the user testing, we were able to find out that <b>our general navigation, and the “Lay” page that we had were not very intuitive</b> and that there was a lot of room for guesswork on the participant’s part. We realized we did not provide much help or guidance to new users and that it may be a lot of mental workload to expect them to understand everything and be able to navigate the app smoothly without this support. For example, the farm theme may need some getting used to at first, so it may not be intuitive that “Lay” is equivalent to “Send” or that “Hatch” is equivalent to “Open”. We also had a very confusing “Lay” page, because we split it up into a two-step process, where you write your message first, and we had two tab bars, with which you could move on to the second step of choosing the options such as Recipient and Scheduled Delay before finishing it off and sending it. Many users did not know what to expect upon pressing “Next” or “Send” or did not even know which one they should press to move on.\n<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, seeing as how this was a key interaction in our application but that it had some pretty critical flaws, we decided to redesign this page of our application. We consolidated the messaging process into a one-page process, such that all the necessary details could be completed and filled up in one page. There would be much less guesswork on the part of the user and resembles more of an email-like structure which people are familiar and comfortable with. We also added a confirmation page before sending the message so that we can make sure that the user is completely aware and informed of what they’re about to do.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<h6>Redesign of Lay Page</h6>\n<h6>Original Lay Page</h6>\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/lay1real.png')} width=\"50%\" alt=\"\" />\n<h6>Redesigned Lay Page</h6>\n<img src = {require('../../Assets/lay2real.png')} width=\"50%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n<p>However, seeing as how our first design did not work as well as we expected, the best way to make sure that this redesign was actually fixing things and improving the user experience, is of course to test on users again! So we did some comparative testing, where we allowed users to use both version of the Lay page, and similar to our previous user testing, we asked them to voice their thoughts aloud during the test. We also observed their actions, and asked them which they found easier to use and other thoughts.\n<br /><br />\n\nIn the end, the new design was comparatively easier to use! We created a walkthrough video with the new page implemented. You can view the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zapk1atJvTk\">walkthrough video on Youtube here</a>. As this was my first hands-on design project, it was definitely a great experience! I’d like to summarize a few key highlights and takeaways in terms of things I enjoyed doing, and things I learnt. Also, I’d like to include some potential future improvements and changes that we were thinking of doing if we could continue working on Telur.\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"summ\"> Summary </h4>\n<p>\n<b>Highlights</b>:\n<ul>\n<li>Working on something that I truly cared about and that I felt was applicable to myself and the people around me.\n</li>\n<li>Learning about people’s typically unobserved natural habits. </li>\n<li>Being able to a variety of things - videomaking, storyboarding, prototyping, coding, observing and testing.\n</li>\n<li>Gaining experience with professional software in a short amount of time (Illustrator, Sketch).\n</li><li>High amount of interaction with people (teammates, audience feedback, peers and testers, mentors).</li></ul>\n<b>Key Takeaways</b>:\n<ul>\n<li>Important not to lose track of why you’re creating in the first place. </li>\n<li>Important to stay motivated and on track. </li>\n<li>Important to continuously seek improvements and not feel complacent. </li>\n<li>Important to see how your creation fares in the real world.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Potential Changes</b>:\n<ul><li>Adding a Reply feature after Hatching An Egg, as it would facilitate conversation and not leave the user at a dead end after reading a message. </li>\n<li>Adding a “Lay” and/or “Hatch” button right under the main egg icon/graphic on the homepage, as these are our key features we can highlight, and this more resembles the original paper prototype we had in mind.\n</li>\n<li>Adding a short tutorial for first-time users to help them adjust and get used to the application flow.\n</li>\n<li>Adding in animations and better graphics to make the experience more enjoyable.</li>\n</ul>\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process of creating this application with my friends.

I decided to put myself out there and get more involved in the Design community around me so I signed myself up! Fast-forward a month or so and there I was walking into a conference room full of people and faces I didn’t know. We kicked off with Intuit’s Lightning Talks, which were refreshing to hear and got me real pumped up about the rest of the day.\n<br /><br />\n  However, even though the atmosphere was exciting, it was also a little bit intimidating because I felt ever-so-slightly <b>out of place</b>, being quite a newbie. The challenge briefs were released and us participants were let out for a lunch break and to mingle. I floated around and somehow ended up chatting with someone in the conference room, who offered me a seat. We talked and he ended up inviting me to join his team of 6 as they were looking for one more person to join them! Lucky me!\n<br /><br />\n  Our group had a <b>good mix of expertise levels</b>, with some people being absolute beginners, to those who’d dabbled in Design a bit (like me), and Design senpais who’d be graduating with their HCI degrees soon. It was really good to know that there’d be different types of perspectives and that I would have a great opportunity to learn from more experienced seniors.\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"briefs\">Challenge Briefs</h5>\n<p>\nThere were 2 challenge briefs - <b>creating a Mint community vs. redesigning TurboTax Live’s onboarding experience</b>, where Mint is Intuit’s web-based personal finance management service and TurboTax Live is an online service allowing you to connect and get tax advice from certified experts. We decided to go with the former, which was initially the road less taken, but we saw it as a good chance to go wide and be more creative and free.\n<br /><br />\nFirst, we had to <b>understand the problem at hand</b> - what were we trying to solve?\nQuoted from the design brief given by Intuit, they wanted to have “a network that helps users understand how to better use the product, how to focus their efforts on finances, what they should be thinking about, and creative ways to manage their money.” They also gave two personas to accommodate - <b>Attack Mode users and Wake-Up-Call users</b>. Attack Mode users are those who are already progressing on their own financial journey, but need assurance that they’re taking the best actions and want to stay on track. Wake-Up-Call users are those who have experienced some fatal alarm in their finances and now want to start better managing their finances. Important points to hit were creating a safe, engaged, supportive and trustworthy community for all Mint users. Considerations included how to structure the community, its link with the actual Mint application itself, profitability, content type and such.\n<br /> <br />\nAt the end of the sprint, which lasted ~4 hours, we were required to present our creative process and a deliverable in the form of an interactive paper or digital prototype. During the creative process, the judges were really looking for us teams to apply <b>Intuit’s D4D (Design for Delight)</b> process in which we should highlight deep customer empathy, a “go broad to go narrow” approach, and rapid experimenting with customers.\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"dce\">Deep Customer Empathy</h5>\n<p>\nTo start off, we took a couple minutes just to go through the design brief individually and highlight key issues that we needed to address or key criteria to hit. We used a lot of Post-its, and I mean a lot. Taking over the desks and then the surrounding walls, we split up into two teams to come up with a spectrum of ways to approach the identified issues and criteria. One team took a more broad approach, while the other took a more narrow approach, zooming in on the two personas given. This way, when we came back together as a whole, we could find the <b>overlapping ideas</b> or the most stand-out issues to conquer and allow ourselves to give some scope and focus to our solution, while ensuring that we target critical areas.\n<br />\n<img  src = {require('../../Assets/DCE.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h5 id=\"gbtgn\">Go Broad to Go Narrow</h5>\n<p>\nI felt so grateful and supported by my team members. At first, it was a little intimidating being surrounded by people who already knew each other, who were familiar with the Design process and who were all around comfortable with voicing out their opinions. Eventually, I realized that if I didn’t try to be more vocal with my ideas and if I didn’t put myself out there, I would really be cheating myself out of the experience. I was thankful that everybody in my group was accepting, and was very rational and respectful about each other’s ideas - so it never felt personal or hurt when an idea was turned down.\n\nSo after much discussion and a hundred Post-Its later, we decided to focus on making a separate application, that featured a Q&A forum. We got inspiration from user-reliant media like Quora and Medium - as it was mentioned in the Design Brief from Intuit that their current communication channels such as Facebook and Twitter were very one-sided, with content mostly coming from them, so it was important to shape the community into one where the user is the one making it come to live.\n<br />\n<img  src = {require('../../Assets/GBTGN.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOur approach applied the D4D, because we went broad in <b>identifying</b> all the issues that could be addressed, and then narrowed down to what we perceived to be the <b>most critical</b> issues - community engagement, trust and support. From here, we went broad again to pick out <b>all the possible features</b> we could implement to tackle these issues and narrow again to what would be our final implementation.\n<br /> <br />\nThis brainstorming part was <b>one of my favourite parts of the challenge</b>, because I felt so free in having and spitting out any ideas, and writing down whatever was in my head. What’s even better is being able to have somebody else envision your idea with you and build on top of it. For example, one of the ideas I had was to incorporate a news feed type dashboard, akin to a Facebook news feed - in which people could share their financial journeys and updates, to boost that sense of community and allow people to feel connected to those with similar goals/interests. It was considered as one of our possible implementations, but in the end we felt that a Q&A forum would be a more direct and easy way for people to get their answers fast.\n<br /> <br />\nUsing the <b>Q&A forum as our base</b>, we were able to build on that and incorporate <b>user profiles with a ranking system</b>, to indicate reliability and assure users that they can get <b>trustworthy advice</b>. This is similar to a <b>Yelp Elite</b> system. We also chose to include a <b>“clap” reaction system</b>, in which users can award a “clap” to an answer they think is good - inspired by <b>Medium</b> article reactions and <b>Yahoo Answers</b> best answers. We intentionally made this a positive scoring system, so that people could feel <b>safe and comfortable</b> posting answers and engaging in the conversation, instead of being scared of being bashed by other users and flamed for their thoughts - which is common on forums like Reddit.\n<br /> <br />\nWith this direction, we <b>sketched out a general wireframe</b> together on a piece of large scratch paper. Once agreed upon, we proceeded to <b>Figma</b> to start working on our digital prototype. Since we were rushing for time, I let the seniors take the reins on this one and watched and learned (as I have only used Figma once with a tutorial a couple years ago). It was impressive to see the familiar hands at work and how fast they could work and deliver something so seamless.\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"rapid\">Rapid Experimenting</h5>\n<p>\nOnce we had our ideas sketched out, we asked one of the Intuit employees to help us test out our product or to give any <b>feedback</b>. He made some really good points, while being supportive of our ideas and gave us some cool things to think about. For example, he proposed the idea of strengthening <b>the selling/engagement point for more expert users</b>. Thanks to his prompt, we went back and <b>reiterated</b> our design to see how we could improve on these weak areas. We decided to include an <b>Articles</b> section, where higher ranked users could get paid to write and publish their own articles as well as a <b>‘Message'</b> feature where higher ranked users could be approached and potentially hired as financial coaches. Not only that, but the Articles section could also be linked to the articles being posted on the Mint blog currently, so that we can incorporate content from the business as well. <br /> </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"final\">Final Stretch</h5>\n<p>\nAt the same time, while some worked on realizing these new added features in Figma, some of us also helped to prepare for the presentation itself - making slides and preparing speech points. It all passed by in a whirl and before we knew it, it was time to present!\n<br /> <br />\nThere were a bunch of really good presentations and ideas. In the end, the judges revealed that we had come in as a <b>close second</b> out of five groups. It was originally a tie, and after careful consideration, they decided that we were lacked in presenting our future vision as compared to the winners.\n<br /> <br />\nWrapping up the day, a few of us stayed behind to talk to the Intuit representatives and just get to know more about the judging decision, and working at Intuit. It was a super fun experience, and it really made me feel so invigorated. I’d never felt like I belonged somewhere, or that I enjoyed doing the work as much as I did during the design sprint. My favourite part was definitely the initial brainstorming and discussions that we had to decide on the final implementations. I definitely aspire to be as deft and skillful as my seniors not only in technical areas such as Figma, but also in being able to prioritize, empathize and think of both the business and the customer. I learnt so much and met so many amazing people - it was a totally unforgettable experience!\n</p>\n<h4 id=\"summ1\"> Summary </h4>\n<p>\n<b>Highlights</b>:\n<ul>\n<li>Being able to learn from such experienced people, and network with them (both on the side of Intuit and in my own team!).\n</li>\n<li>Working on a project outside of the classroom.</li>\n<li>Feeling inspired to be more independent and confident in pursuing my dreams.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Key Takeaways</b>:\n<ul>\n<li>It is so important to be open-minded yet rational, when working in a team. </li>\n<li>You can accomplish so much in a short amount of time if you set your mind & heart to it.  </li>\n<li>You’re only cheating yourself if you don’t put yourself out there. </li>\n<li>Don’t be scared to ask for advice from others.</li>\n<li>Don’t stop here, keep looking towards the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Potential Changes</b>:\n<ul><li>More thought into potential business models, incorporation with the Mint app itself. </li>\n<li>Personalization into suggested topics on the dashboard. </li>\n<li>Ability to join groups/circles to make the experience more specific for a deeper connection.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DFMint;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Header from '../headerComponent/header';\n\nclass PSF extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n      <Header />\n      <div className=\"aboutMe\">\n          <h1>Petrosains Science Festival</h1>\n      <div className=\"myCard\">\n      <p>As part of my summer internship in Freshman year in 2017, I joined a small startup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. During my time there, I worked on a project for a client (Petrosains), developing a responsive website for a Science Festival event. The website design and assets itself are provided by the client, and I was required to recreate it. I mainly used <b>Wordpress</b> to develop the website, as well as <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b> to add personalization to the many different plug-ins available on Wordpress. I also used a bit of <b>PHP</b> to link data from <b>mySQL</b> tables, storing details of the different event activities and schedules, to individual event pages on the website.</p>\n      <p>\n      A lot of the process was <b>self-learning</b> as I had not developed a website before, and there were times I was not sure whether I could achieve what was wanted. But eventually, I always did my best to find the closest solution possible and pushed myself to see what could be done. When I finished my internship, I was about 90% done with the website, as they wanted it. From there, the company and client took over my work and made finishing touches. Below are screenshots of the final product.\n      </p>\n      <h6>Landing Screen with Sticky Header Menu and Logo</h6>\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF1.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <h6>Image Slider with Highlights</h6>\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF2.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF3.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF4.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF5.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF6.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n      <img src = {require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF7.png')} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" />\n<br />\n  <p>Unfortunately I could not get images of the individual event pages. The website gets updated annually as the event is rolled out annually, but <a href=\"http://www.sciencefestival.my\">the website can be found here</a>. As of now the design has remained pretty similar, but it is very different and more graphical, interactive and attractive than how it looked in the previous years before I worked on it, so I'm proud to say I feel like I contributed quite a lot to its revamp.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default PSF;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Header from '../headerComponent/header';\n\nclass Portfolio extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n      <Header />\n      <div className=\"aboutMe\">\n          <h1 className=\"animated fadeInUp\"> My Portfolio</h1>\n      <div className=\"myCard\">\n      <div className=\"homeCards\">\n            <div className=\"card-deck\">\n              <div className=\"card\">\n            <a href=\"/telur\">\n            <img className=\"card-img-top\" src = {require('../../Assets/telur-bigrect.png')} alt=\"Card image cap\" />\n            </a>\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                  <a className =\"normalLink\" href=\"/telur\"><h5 className=\"card-title\">Telur</h5></a>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\">Telur is my first full-on Design project, featuring all steps of a human-centered design process from needfinding and storyboarding to prototyping and launch!</p>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\"><small className=\"text-muted\">Last updated 3 mins ago</small></p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"card\">\n              <a href=\"/dfmint\">\n                <img className=\"card-img-top\" src={require('../../Assets/MintRect.png')} alt=\"Card image cap\" />\n                </a>\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                <a className =\"normalLink\" href=\"/dfmint\"><h5 className=\"card-title\">Mint Community Redesign</h5></a>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\">As part of my first Design sprint, my team and I designed a community platform for Intuit's personal financing application, Mint.</p>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\"><small className=\"text-muted\">Last updated 3 mins ago</small></p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"card\">\n              <a href=\"/psf\">\n                <img className=\"card-img-top\" src={require('../../Assets/PSF/PSF1.png')} alt=\"Card image cap\" />\n              </a>\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                  <a className =\"normalLink\" href=\"/dfmint\">  <h5 className=\"card-title\">Petrosains Science Festival</h5></a>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\">During my first Summer internship, I led a website development project for a client.</p>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\"><small className=\"text-muted\">Last updated 3 mins ago</small></p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Portfolio;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport Header from './components/headerComponent/header';\nimport Footer from './components/footerComponent/footer';\nimport Homepage from './components/pages/homePage';\nimport AboutMe from './components/pages/aboutMe';\nimport Telur from './components/pages/telur';\nimport DFMint from './components/pages/dfmint';\nimport PSF from './components/pages/psf';\nimport Portfolio from './components/pages/Portfolio';\n\n\nimport './Assets/css/default.min.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Router>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n      <Route exact path='/' component={Homepage} />\n      <Route exact path='/AboutMe' component={AboutMe} />\n      <Route exact path='/telur' component={Telur} />\n      <Route exact path='/dfmint' component={DFMint} />\n      <Route exact path='/psf' component={PSF} />\n      <Route exact path='/portfolio' component={Portfolio} />\n\n      </div>\n      </Router>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
