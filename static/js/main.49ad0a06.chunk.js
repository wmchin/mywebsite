What\u2019s even better is being able to have somebody else envision your idea with you and build on top of it. For example, one of the ideas I had was to incorporate a news feed type dashboard, akin to a Facebook news feed - in which people could share their financial journeys and updates, to boost that sense of community and allow people to feel connected to those with similar goals/interests.

This is similar to a ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"Yelp Elite")," system. We also chose to include a ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"\u201cclap\u201d reaction system"),", in which users can award a \u201cclap\u201d to an answer they think is good - inspired by ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"Medium")," article reactions and ",r.a.createElement("b",null,"Yahoo Answers")," best answers.
